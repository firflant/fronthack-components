import React from 'react'

export default () => <div>
  <p>When you consider the work on the <code>index.html</code> file as done, you will probably want to code the rest of subpages in the same way. To automate this process, use a following command. It is analogous to <code>fronthack component</code>. </p>

  <pre><code>fronthack page</code></pre>

  <p>This command will ask for a page name, then will create a new html file with the default structure in the <code>src</code> directory, if it is a static site project, or create new functional component under the <code>pages</code> directory, if it is a React app.</p>

  <p>The newly created subpage can be paired with design the same way as it was done with <code>index</code> example from previous chapters.</p>

</div>
