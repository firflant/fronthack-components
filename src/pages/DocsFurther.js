import React from 'react'

export default () => <div>
  <p>When you consider the work on the <code>index.html</code> file as done, you will probably want to code the rest of subpages in the same way. To automate this process, use the following command:</p>

  <pre><code>fronthack page</code></pre>

  <p>It will ask for a page name, then if it is a static site project, will create new html file with the default structure in the <code>src</code> directory. If it is a React app, it will create new functional component under the <code>pages</code> directory.</p>

  <p>The newly created subpage can be paired with design the same way, like it was done before in <strong>Recognition of designs</strong> chapter.</p>

</div>
